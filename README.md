# Student-Management-Systems
The Student Management System in Java is a simple, console-based project that brings together Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts with basic data structures, searching, and sorting algorithms. It lets users easily add, view, search, and sort student records through a clear, menu-driven interface, making it both practical and interactive.
The project is organized into separate classes for better structure and clarity. The Student class uses encapsulation to keep student details private while providing public methods to access them. The Sorting class implements Bubble Sort to arrange students by marks and Quick Sort to organize them by name. The Searching class includes Linear Search to find students by ID and Binary Search to locate them by name after sorting. The main StudentManagementSystem class handles the menu, user input, and calls the appropriate methods.
Student records are stored in an ArrayList, which allows dynamic addition and easy retrieval of data. The project also demonstrates abstraction by separating core functionalities into different classes and supports polymorphism, making it flexible for future extensions.
